 IFM: Interactive Fiction Mapper

About this package
==================

This is the Windows distribution of IFM.  Only the main executable, its
library files, and a bunch of examples are included here.  For
documentation on how to use IFM, see http://ifm.readthedocs.org.

Installation
============

Just unpack the ZIP archive (like you appear to have done :-) and run the
executable.  No installation required.  The executable looks in the ``ifm``
folder to find the files it needs.

Copyright
=========

IFM and its utility programs are free software, and you may redistribute
them under certain conditions; see the file ``COPYING`` for details.
